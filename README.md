## Conclusion

In the project development, we started by building the "Extrato" and "Nova TransferÃªncia" components, recognizing the need to translate the texts to the local language of Brazil in order to provide a better user experience.

To meet this requirement, we registered the localization of Brazil in the app-module file, configuring Brazilian standards for localization throughout the application.

Later on, we realized the need to persist data even when refreshing the page. To achieve this, we created a service class responsible for storing and managing this data, ensuring its integrity during navigation.

During the implementation of this service class, we identified an opportunity to utilize an external API for storing the persistent data. Consequently, we integrated the API, allowing the components to access and synchronize data with this external source.

With the components properly connected to the external API and data persistently stored, we moved on to the route creation step. Using the Angular routing service, we transformed the components into navigable pages, thus completing the core functionality of the project.

By concluding this process, the application was ready, delivering the intended functionality and successfully completing the development course.
